# Python-MazeGame
This is a simple game made whit python for a university project.

## About The Project
The original concept for this project was to have a game that worked similarly to the game "Pac-Man" where the playing field was in the form of a maze and the player character had to collect specific objects while there were enemies that were an obstacle to the player. The project was made for a python class in my second year of university. The project itself is a pretty simple version of what can be made using "Pac-Man" as an inspiration.
